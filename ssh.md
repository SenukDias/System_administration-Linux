SSH (Secure Shell) is a widely used network protocol that allows secure remote access to Linux systems. It provides a secure channel over an unsecured network by encrypting the connection and authenticating the parties involved. With SSH, users can securely log in to a remote server, execute commands, transfer files, and perform various administrative tasks. It is an essential tool for system administrators and developers who need to manage Linux servers remotely. SSH offers strong security features, including public-key authentication, password authentication, and data encryption, making it a reliable choice for secure remote access.
```
$ ssh-keygen
```
The `ssh-keygen` command is used to generate SSH key pairs for secure authentication.
